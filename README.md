# Hot-dog-or-not-hot-dog
This project was created as a way to practice the skills gathered through the first part of the Deeplearning.ai course in Coursera's deep learning specialization.

This current implementation does not provide the most accurate solution. Possible reasons for this is:
  - Insufficient data
  - Too high or too low of a learning rate
  - Insufficient amount of layers

Feel free to make use of the code and edit it.
